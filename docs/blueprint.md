# **App Name**: 食刻

## Core Features:

- Logo Animation: Display a logo animation on app startup for approximately two seconds.
- Connectivity Check: Check for Wi-Fi connectivity upon app launch. If connected, navigate to the main page. If not, display a message prompting the user to connect to Wi-Fi with a retry button.
- Web View Integration: Display the website https://peterkuo0108.github.io/eattime/ in a full-screen web view. Ensure that any navigation to a different domain opens in the user's default browser.

## Style Guidelines:

- Use a clean, minimalist color palette with a predominantly white or light gray background.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) for buttons and interactive elements to provide a subtle yet noticeable highlight.
- Ensure the web view fills the entire screen, adapting to various device sizes and orientations. Maintain consistent padding and margins for a clean look.
- Use simple, line-based icons for the retry button and any other UI elements.
- Keep animations subtle and smooth. The logo animation should be clean and not overly distracting.
